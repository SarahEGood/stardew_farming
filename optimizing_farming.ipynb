    "# Optimizing Stardew Valley Farming\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "When I am not busy with schoolwork, I like to play a game called Stardew Valley. The premise of the game is that your character inherits a farm from your late grandfather and use the land to grow crops in order to earn money. While there are other features, such as fishing, slaying monsters, and making friends with the villagers, optimising the farming component of this game is what will be focused on. This is because crops are usually the most lucrative part of the game while also requiring the most foresight, since all crops take multiple in-game days to grow."

    "* The player starts with 500 gold on Day 1, and has until Day 28 to grow crops.\n",
    "* The player also starts with 5 Parsnip seeds, which we assume they will start growing on Day 1.\n",
    "* The gold can be exchanged for seeds of varying costs, usually depending on how much the resulting crop will sell for.\n",
    "* The crop growing times increment each day, meaning that a parsnip that is planted on Day 1 and takes 5 days to grow will be ready to harvest on Day 6, not Day 5.\n",
    "* Seeds whose grow times exceed the time available left in the season cannot be bought or grown. (This is possible in game, but results in \"wasting\" the seeds, and thus is suboptimal.)\n",

    "\\text{Gold at time t} = (\\text{Produce sold by t}) - (\\text{Seeds bought by t})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between buying a crop and selling a crop at after $k$ days can be represented the following way, where $s_{Crop}(t)$ and $b_{Crop}(t)$ represents the number of crops of a specific type bought or sold at time $t$.:\n",

    "s_{Crop}(t+k) = -b_{Crop}(t)\n",

If the day is 13 or 24, the buy process is skipped entirely, as these are \"Festival Days\" in game where items cannot be bought or sold.\n",
    "* If any crops mature by time $t$, they will be sold and the gold will be available the same day or (on days 3, 10, 13, 17, and 24) the following day. The constraint of the latter exists due to the shopkeeper not being available on the listed days.\n",

    "## Optimisation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The (theoretically) \"best\" solution would iterate through all combinations of seeds that could be bought on each day. However, this is not a practical solution because all future days are dependent on the buying decisions from the current day. Combine this with the fact that there are multiple seeds that can be bought almost every day, and this presents a challenge when figuring out how to optimise these decisions overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Profit per Day Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach that was applied was one where, at every given opportunity, the algorithm chooses to always spend the most gold possible when it is available to buy the crops that yield the highest profit per day of growing. This is because the opportunity cost of buying seeds at one day means that there is less gold to use to buy seeds on all subsequent days (at least until the crop grows and is sold). This means that regrowables, which renew their crops after harvest, must have their profit per day recalculated depending on what day it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Profit per Day with Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is identical to the above approach except the rate at which all gold is used and the rate at which the algorithm chooses the highest \"profit per day\" crop varies. This is randomized because it is difficult to foresee cases when saving gold or buying \"suboptimal\" crops provides a better result than otherwise doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods 3 and 4: Quickest Turnaround (without and with Randomization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since time is a constraint, this method is similar to Method 1 and 2 except the seeds prioritized are the ones with the quickest grow rates. This is because while in the long run, profit per day may be the best method of generating gold, time is a limiting factor for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 5: Highest \"Interest\"\n",
    "This method prioritizes buying seeds based on the highest ROI adjusted for time. Specifically, the formula for this \"interest\" is as follows (for each crop):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Interest} = (\\frac{\\text{Seed Price}}{\\text{Sell Price}})^{\\text{Days to Harvest}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is modified for the Green Bean and Strawberry crops in the following way, depending on the number of times these crops regenerate more crops after the initial harvest:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Interest} = (\\frac{\\text{Seed Price}}{\\text{Sell Price}})^{\\text{Days to Harvest}}+ (\\frac{\\text{Seed Price}}{\\text{Sell Price}})^{\\text{Days to Harvest}+\\text{Days to Regrow}} + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 6: Mix and Match\n",
    "\n",
    "This method switches between the above methods in calculating the best seeds to buy during the \"season\" and uses only non-random methods to do this. There is likely a trade off in mid-term profitability between at least two of the above methods, so switching strategies at some point in the algorithm is likely a good choice."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The results from our algorithm suggest that crop turnover is the most important thing in terms of optimizing the gold that is received by the end of the season. It appears that the overall profitability of crops depends most on the ability to sell them quickly after planting them instead of net profit. As can be seen below, even when the time scale for the season is inflated to be longer than it actually is in game, crops with high turnover consistently outperform all other selection methods, with flat net profit being the worst valuation method. These methods yield 70,225 and 19,282 gold respectively."

    "## Model Critique\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is useful in that it illustrates how powerful crops with low growing times are if the goal is to grow the most profitable crops. While it is hard to not make money farming in the game, it is difficult to figure out how to optimise seed buying decisions to maximize profitability. (At least after planting enough of the other crops to get certain in-game rewards). Most guides for Stardew Valley will list \"Profit per Day\" when listing out crops for each season. However, the results of the model clearly that the opportunity cost of planting crops that take a lot of time to grow compared to ones that can be harvested quicker is significant and should actually be taken into account to anyone who would like to optimise their playthrough. (However, brutal optimisation this is actually somewhat antithetical to the ethos the game attempts to portray, but this is beside the point.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model might be improved further if it could evaluate the tradeoff between saving gold on certain days to buy Strawberry seeds on day 13. This could not be accounted for in the algorithmn as it currently exists since it assumes that the player will always use gold at the earliest opportunities. The *diversion_rate* component of this algorithm may also be improved if the algorithm was limited to choosing the second best choices according to their selection criteria rather than all available seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also does not account for the following game mechanics that would influence the seed buying decisions overtime:\n",
    "* **Fatigue**: The player must use energy to plow fields to plant the seeds, then use more energy to water the seeds and crops during the growing time. This means that realistically, fatigue can limit the player's ability to keep crops growing overtime. This would most effect crops like Parsnips, which the current model suggests the player should buy in high numbers. Conversely, crops like Cauliflower, which are more expensive to buy but payout more per seed, may be favored more in a model that factors in the upper limits of fatigue. Furthermore, energy use for plowing and watering decreases as the player harvests more crops, which would also influence this theoretical model.\n",
    "* **Other Income and Expenses**: The player can also earn gold from other methods, such as fishing, mining, and foraging. The model does not account for the income from these activities nor does it account for the player buying items either relating to these activities among other reasons. The model could be written to be more complex either to allow gold to be decremented from the farm (such as to buy certain items) or to account for income from other sources that could then be used to buy more seeds.\n",
    "* **Crop Quality**: The crop sell prices actually do vary considerably depending on the \"quality\" of the crop, which are rated as such with a silver, gold, and iridium (made up rare element) stars if it is above the base quality. The chances of getting a higher quality version of the crop from a given harvest depends on either using certain items on the plowed land before planting the seeds and by how high the farmer's \"farming level\" is. Since the current model assumes no item use and assumes all crops produced are of regular quality, the results of the model actually understate the amount of gold that will be earned on average per crop and actually better approximates the lower limit of what is possible."
